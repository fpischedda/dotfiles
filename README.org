This repo should help me not lose my configs...

* Applications

** Emacs
*** Dependencies
Requires use-package

It can be copied or fetched from its repo directly to ~/.emacs.d
or installed using M-x package-install

When runnin Emacs for first time the installation of the packages
will probably fail if the package index is not up to date, in this
case run M-x package-refresh-contents and restart Emacs; the installation
process should succed now.

*** Installation
Symlink emacs.el to ~/.emacs.d/init.el

** Vim
*** Dependencies
Requires vim-plug (plug.vim)
Please refer to https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug for detailed
instructions

*** Installation
Symlink vim/vimrc to ~/.vimrc
